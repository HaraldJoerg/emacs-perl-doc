* Changes in perl-doc.el 0.8 - August 2023

** Speedbar Support

perl-doc now has its own display in speedbar.  It is accessible either
by starting <M-x> speedbar while looking at a buffer in perl-doc-mode
or by starting <M-x> perl-doc-browser.  In the latter case, which also
works if emacs is started in a terminal, you can leave perl-doc
display with the command <M-x> perl-doc-browser-quit (bound to "q" in
the speedbar frame).

** Completion of module names

The perl-doc command now offers completion for modules which are
installed on your system (fine print: The modules who are available to
the Perl executable customized as perl-doc-perl-program).

** New functions

Documentation for builtin functions and variables is now available via
the new commands perl-doc-function and perl-doc-variable.  They don't
do completion, though (I have no easily accessible authoritative
source for the completion candidates).

The commands perl-doc-browser and perl-doc-browser-quit start and
stop perl-doc view in speedbar.

The command perl-doc-add-lib allows to add an existing directory (with
completion) for the current session.  To add a directory permanently,
see the new customization option perl-doc-extra-libs below.

** New customization options

The option perl-doc-perl-program is the file name of the Perl
executable for which documentation is to be displayed.  perl-doc.el
runs the one-liner "perl -E 'say for @INC'" to get the list of
directories where Perl modules (and their documentation) reside.

The option perl-doc-extra-libs allows to add a list of directories, on
top of the builtin ones and those from PERL5LIB.

** Bugfixes

Refreshing the view doesn't happen quite as often (only if the width
of the window changes), and if it ever happens, it does no longer kill
imenu's menubar-index (errors reported by LanX on PerlMonks)

** Known bugs and limitations

The display of Perl documentation is done in a scratch buffer which is
not associated with a file.  This means that there's no point in
editing this buffer or saving it.

The error handling could be better.  If a Perl documentation buffer
shows "No documentation found for Your::Module", then you don't know
whether the file Your/Module.pm has no POD in it or whether it does
not exist at all.  In the former case, you can still use "v" to view
the source of Your/Module.pm (and add some POD, of course), the latter
should not happen if you let yourself be guided by the module name
completion.

* Changes in perl-doc.el 0.6

Bugfix: A vertical bar in markup is now processed correctly (seen in
perlport.pod).

* Changes in perl-doc.el 0.3

** New command `perl-doc-file'

Like `perl-doc', but prompt for a file name with completion.

** New command `perl-doc-view-source'

View the POD source for the Perl documentation shown in the current
buffer.  The command is bound to "v" in `perl-doc-mode'.
