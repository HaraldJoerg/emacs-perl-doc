	* NEWS: New file, loosely following Emacs conventions.

	* README.md: Add the commands available in this package.

2022-09-26  Harald Jörg  <haj@posteo.de>

	* perl-doc.el: The home-grown compact regex construction set has
	been replaced by rx notation.  This is less compact, but easier to
	maintain (I hope).
	(perl-doc-mode-map): New key "v" to invoke `perl-doc-view-source'.
	(perl-doc-goto-section): Bugfix: Sections with regexp
	metacharacters in their titles are now found.
	(perl-doc-with-L-grammar): New macro to run elisp code with a
	lexical definition for the L<...> element of POD syntax in rx
	notation.
	(perl-doc--process-links): Eliminate the definition of string
	regexps in favor of rx notation (which is factored out to the
	macro `perl-doc-with-L-grammar').
	(perl-doc-file): New command to run `perl-doc' with completion for
	a file name.
	(perl-doc-view-source): New command to view the POD source for the
	documentation in the current buffer.

	* test/perl-doc-tests.el: Some tests for perl-doc.el, in
	particular for the regular expressions used.

	* .elpaignore: New file, exclude tests from the package
