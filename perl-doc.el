;;; Commentary:

;; This file contains a command to read Perl documentation in Emacs.
;; It uses two external commands which come with Perl: `perldoc` to
;; locate the Perl documentation for the Perl modules installed on
;; your system, and `pod2html` to format the documentation to HTML.
;; This HTML version is then displayed using Emacs' "simple HTML
;; renderer" shr.
;;
;; Motivation
;;
;; Perl documentation is written in a markup format called POD ("Plain
;; Old Documentation") and is usually converted to other formats for
;; reading by humans.  The documentation used to be available in Emacs
;; for a long time in 'info' or 'man' format.  However, Perl does no
;; longer ship 'info' files, and the software available from CPAN
;; never did.  'man' is not available on all platforms and allows only
;; rather restricted formatting, most notably linking between
;; documents does not work.

;; On the other hand, Perl provides a converter from POD to HTML.
;; HTML is well supported by Emacs and is well suited for presentation
;; of structured documents.

;; The user visible benefits over the other formats are:
;;
;;  * Works nicely on platforms which do not have man
;;
;;  * Unlike with 'man', Hyperlinks between POD documents work and
;;   resolve to POD documentation on your system, no web server
;;   required.
;;
;;  * Makes use of Emacs faces: variable-pitch font for text,
;;    fixed-pitch for code, italics for, well, italics

;;; Code:

;;; Compatibility with older Emacs versions
;; Available in Emacs 28: format-prompt
